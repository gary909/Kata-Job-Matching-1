    <p>
        Let's build a matchmaking system that helps discover jobs for developers based on a number of factors.<br>
<br>
        One of the simplest, yet most important factors is compensation. As developers we know how much money <br>
        we need to support our lifestyle, so we generally have a rough idea of the minimum salary we would be <br>
        satisfied with.<br>
<br>
        Let's give this a try. We'll create a function match which takes a candidate and a job, which will return <br>
        a boolean indicating whether the job is a valid match for the candidate.<br>
<br>
        A candidate will have a minimum salary, so it will look like this:<br>
<br>
        let candidate = {<br>
        minSalary: 120000<br>
        }<br>
        A job will have a maximum salary, so it will look like this:<br>
<br>
        let job = {<br>
        maxSalary: 140000<br>
        }<br>
        If either the candidate's minimum salary or the job's maximum salary is not present, throw an error.<br>
<br>
        For a valid match, the candidate's minimum salary must be less than or equal to the job's maximum salary. <br>
        However, let's also include 10% wiggle room (deducted from the candidate's minimum salary) in case the <br>
        candidate is a rockstar who enjoys programming on Codewars in their spare time. The company offering the <br>
        job may be able to work something out.<br>
